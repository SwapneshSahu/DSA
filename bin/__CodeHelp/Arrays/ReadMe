TO access 2D array in form of 1d 
Let see we have row =4  and Column = 6
And we want to find at which index of 1D array Arr[3][2]  value will be placed  and vice versa 

/****FORMULA***/

2D to 1D    index = Total Column * row + col

1D to 2D     row = index/Total Column   col = index% Total Column  Note(it will be 0 based indexing 0,1,2... )
